# Bass pre-amp circuit

This is a simple preamp with some basic tone control intended to be paired with
a piezo pickup in a clone of one of the range of 21" scale rubber string'ed bass
guitars (aka ukulele bass).  It's very much a work in progress, and any edits
are appreciated.

The drawings are all made with Kicad.
